Author's Note
=============
If you look up the other Quake maps I've made, they're pretty much all gimmick maps that do something radically different from most levels. I like always having the oddball map in speedmap packs, but I also feel like maybe the gimmicks have just been propping up unpolished gameplay. So I decided to make an episode of just solid shooter gameplay and enemy design. Call it an experiement in non-experimentation. Not that I didn't try anything new, but I wanted to make something that felt like a real Quake episode, just this once. Hey, maybe that's a mistake and I should just commit to gimmick levels all the way. Either way, I hope you enjoy Power Surge!

Thanks for reading!
